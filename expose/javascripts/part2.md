1. it will print 3 as i = 3 after the for loops runned 3 times and stopped.
2. it will print 150 for the last item in prices[i] is 300, and thus discountedPrice is last declared as 300 * 0.5 = 150.
3. it will print 150. finalPrice is last declared as 150 * 100 / 100 which remains as the value 150.
4. the function will return the array [50, 100, 150] because each price in the input array is reduced by 50%.
5. ERROR! i is defined in the for loop using let and thus it is not accessble in line 12.
6. ERROR! discountedPrice is defined in the for loop using let and thus it is not accessble in line 12.
7. it will print 150. finalPrice is last declared as 150 * 100 / 100 which remains as the value 150.
8. The function will return [50, 100, 150] for each price in the input array is reduced by 50% (similar to #4 but with let declaration).
9. ERROR! Cannot reassign value to const discountedPrice.
10. it will print 3 as length is defined as the number of elements in prices[]. There are 3 elemetn in prices[] and therefore length = 3.
11. The fuction will return [50, 100, 150] but discounted prices are not rounded to two decimal places in this version of the function.

15. === operator does not perform type coercion, which means that if the operands are of different types, the comparison will return false. == operator performs type coercion, which means it converts one of the operands to the same type as the other before making the comparison.
